This repository contains a series of code snippets used in the online game "Adventureland".
Adventureland's niche was that you could create code to fully automate your characters, including everything from combat to player interaction.
The repo itself isn't particularly well organized as it was just a quick way for me to be able to work on the code between multiple computers, but the comments reflect the purpose and intent of each commit.
